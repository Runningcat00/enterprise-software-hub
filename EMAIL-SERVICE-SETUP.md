# ðŸ“§ Email Service Setup - Fix Email Delivery

## ðŸš¨ Current Issue: No Emails Being Sent

Your newsletter signup is working but not sending actual emails. Let's fix this by setting up Resend (recommended) or SendGrid for email delivery.

## ðŸš€ Quick Fix: Resend Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Resend Account
1. **Go to**: https://resend.com
2. **Sign up** with your email

### Step 2: Get API Key
1. **Create new API key**
2. **Copy the key** (starts with `re_`)
3. **Keep it secure** - you'll add it to Vercel

### Step 3: Add Domain to Resend
1. **Go to Domains** in Resend dashboard
2. **Add domain**: enterprisesoftwarehub.com
3. **Add DNS records** they provide (similar to what you did for Titan)
4. **Verify domain**

### Step 4: Add API Key to Vercel
1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/tahshawn-brinsons-projects/enterprise-software-hub/settings/environment-variables
2. **Add new variable**:
   - Name: `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - Value: [your Resend API key]
3. **Save**

### Step 5: Redeploy
The code is already ready - just redeploy:
```bash
cd "Enterprise-Software-Hub"
npx vercel --prod
```
