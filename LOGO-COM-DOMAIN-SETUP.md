# üåê Logo.com Domain Connection to Vercel

## Step-by-Step Guide: EnterpriseSoftwareHub.com ‚Üí Vercel

   https://vercel.com/tahshawn-brinsons-projects/enterprise-software-hub

2. **Click "Settings"** in the top navigation

3. **Click "Domains"** in the left sidebar

4. **Click "Add Domain"** button

5. **Enter your domain**: `enterprisesoftwarehub.com`

6. **Click "Add"** - Vercel will show you DNS instructions

7. **Also add www version**:
   - Click "Add Domain" again
   - Enter: `www.enterprisesoftwarehub.com`
   - Set to redirect to main domain

### Part 2: Configure DNS in Logo.com (3 minutes)

#### Option A: Logo.com Dashboard Method

1. **Login to Logo.com** account

2. **Navigate to "My Domains"** or "Domain Management"

3. **Find EnterpriseSoftwareHub.com** in your domain list

4. **Click "Manage DNS"** or "DNS Settings"

5. **Add these DNS records**:

   **Record 1 (Root Domain):**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @ (or leave blank)
   Value: 76.76.21.21
   TTL: 3600 (or Auto)
   ```

   **Record 2 (WWW Subdomain):**
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   TTL: 3600 (or Auto)
   ```

6. **Save Changes**

#### Option B: If Logo.com Uses Wix DNS

Since Logo.com may use Wix for website building, they might manage DNS differently:

1. **In Logo.com dashboard**, look for:
   - "Connect External Site"
   - "Point to External Host" 
   - "Custom DNS"
   - "Advanced DNS Settings"

2. **If you see Wix integration**:
   - Look for "Connect to External Provider"
   - Select "Custom/Other Provider"
   - Enter the DNS records above

### Part 3: Alternative - Change Nameservers (If needed)

If Logo.com doesn't allow custom DNS records:

1. **In Vercel**, go to your domain settings
2. **Look for "Nameservers"** option
3. **Copy Vercel's nameservers** (usually):
   ```
   ns1.vercel-dns.com
   ns2.vercel-dns.com
   ```

4. **In Logo.com**:
   - Find "Nameservers" or "DNS Management"
   - Change from Logo.com nameservers to Vercel nameservers
   - **Warning**: This may affect any email services

### Part 4: Verification (15 minutes - 2 hours)

#### Immediate Check:
1. **In Vercel dashboard**, check domain status
2. **Should show**: "Pending" or "Configuring"

#### DNS Propagation Check:
1. **Visit**: https://whatsmydns.net

4. **Should show**: 76.76.21.21 globally

1. **Wait 15-30 minutes** minimum
